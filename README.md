# RasmussenTechnology 
An iOS Application that functions as a catalog of different degrees that the School of Technology of Rasmussen College offers. 

It was created for an assignment in COP3362C Apple iOS Programming I at Rasmussen College. It is object oriented and it has just a few features but will most likely be expanded in my free time.

What it can do so far:
* Display information about the School of Technology.
* Display a list of the different degrees that the school offers as well as their information and list of courses. 
* Quick access to different websites from the school.
